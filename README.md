==========================================================

Description
-----------

_CoDServerWatcher_ is a systray application for Windows used to automatically connect a Call of Duty server when a slot is free.

_CoDServerWatcher_ enables you to get details on a Call of Duty Multiplayer server without launching the game. The application runs in the system tray to be as less intrusive as possible.

**Important**: I don't know if _CoDServerWatcher_ works with all versions of Call of Duty, I developed it for Call of Duty - Modern Warfare and tested only with Call of Duty - Modern Warfare (Call of Duty 4).

Features
--------

* Shows current map, number of players and players list.
* Enables you to quickly join a server, without going into the Call of Duty servers browser.
* Enables you to automatically connect a full server as soon as a slot is free.
* Runs in systray.

Usage
-----

1. [Download](https://github.com/Otiel/CoDServerWatcher/releases/latest) the latest version from the page as a zip file.
2. Make sure the following files are located in the same folder:
    * `CoDServerWatcher.exe`,
    * `CoDServerWatcher.ini`,
    * `qstat.exe`,
    * `qstat.cfg`.
3. Run `CoDServerWatcher.exe`.
