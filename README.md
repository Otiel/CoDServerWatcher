CoD Server Watcher
==================

Description
-----------

CoDServerWatcher is a systray application used to automatically connect a Call of Duty server when a slot is free.

CoDServerWatcher enables you to get details on a Call of Duty Multiplayer server without launching the game. The application runs in the system tray to be as less intrusive as possible.

Features
--------

* Shows current map, number of players and players list.
* Enables you to quickly join the server, without going into the Call of Duty servers browser.
* Enables you to automatically connect a full server as soon as a slot is free.
* Runs in systray.

------------
